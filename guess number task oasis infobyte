// Number Guessing Game
// This code is done by Vishal Kumar Patel
// You have to guess any number between 1 to 100.
/* The code is design in such a way that it will choose any number between 1 to 100, and the user have to guess the correct number.
 if the user will choose a number which is higher than the correct number then a message will prompt saying the guess is too high or if you choose a number
   which is lower than the correct number then the message will prompt saying the Guess is too low */
